# Feature Completed and Notes

All CSS is custom and written for this assignment with the exception of the toggle button and graphs.

Created a custom table that allows user to easily see, edit, delete, and add transaction data.

This includes the creation of several endpoints with GraphQL and MongoDB as the webserver was not set up to edit or delete transactions.

Created a graph page that demonstrates processing particular data from the database and displaying it

Created a toggle switch that will switch all visible numbers on the page to Roman numerals, including numbers found with strings of text in paragraphs. (Will also change the colors of the graphs)

Created a seed script in the web server that will add some fun data to the database via post install

Added an i18n setting via url if you add '?i18n=true' to any webpage url, it will translate all text to Korean gibberish.

Added better navigation and styling, including a custom button and header and custom form for editing and accompanying animations.

A bonus fun route to be able to see some of the features a little better like the button

# Divvy Homework Assignment

This repository provides a starting point for a basic React + GraphQL application.
All of the configuration boilerplate is complete so you can start by writing the code that you want us to see.

Please **fork** this repo a **private repo** on your GitHub account.

Please share your finished project repo with @thawk55 and @jakerichan as part of your submission.

## Project Setup

This repository is split into a web app directory (eg `/webapp`) and two server directories (eg `/webserver` and `/elixir`).

The `/webserver` one includes a functional GraphQL server in NodeJS with MongoDB backing it.

The `/elixir` one includes a functional GraphQL server in Elixir with Postgresql backing it.

If you are applying for backend, you should use the elixir code.
If you are applying for frontend, feel free to use either.

This project is _intentionally not utilizing 3rd party services or create-react-app_ to give you the opportunity to showcase your talents wherever they are, be it the front end or the back end.

## Instructions

If you are pursuing a full stack or backend position, please include elixir code changes in your homework.

See the [Frontend instructions](webapp/README.md) for frontend focused instructions.  If front end only, use the node server in `/webserver`.

See the [Backend instructions](backend.md) for backend focused instructions.
